            </h4>
            <p className="term__description">You may enroll on a month to month basis, in which case your monthly Membership Fee will be due monthly in advance or you may enroll for a one (1)-year term in which case the annual Membership Fee will be paid in advance. For both the monthly memberships and the annual membership, we will bill your credit card accordingly.  For monthly memberships, the Dental Membership Plan will automatically renew your membership at the end of each month on a month to month basis, and your credit card will be automatically charged the monthly Membership Fee as described above, unless you cancel your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan as provided below.</p>
            <p className="term__description">For annual memberships, you will receive an email from us not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current annual period, which will provide instructions for you to renew your membership. Should you elect to renew your membership for the next annual period, your credit card will be charged the then-current annual Membership Fee.</p>
            <p className="term__description">Your renewal and payment must be received by us prior to the expiration date of the then current term in order to avoid interruption of your membership in the Dental Membership Plan.</p>

              3. THE DENTAL MEMBERSHIP PLAN
            </h4>
            <p className="term__description">The Dental Membership Plan is a prepaid discount membership program for dental services which is being offered by DentalHQ. Certain dentists and dental practices have contracted with DentalHQ to be participating providers (“Dentists”) under the Dental Membership Plan and to provide certain specified dental services to you for no out of pocket fees (“Covered Services”). Additional services may be provided at discount rates pursuant the Dentist’s fee schedule (“Fee Schedule”). In most cases, the discounted fees are provided at predetermined rates and at a percentage off the Dentists’ current rates for such designated dental services. When selecting a Dentist under the Dental Membership Plan, you are required to confirm that such Dentist is a current Dentist under the Dental Membership Plan and that his or her Fee Schedule is up to date.</p>
            <p className="term__description">The Dental Membership Plan itself does not pay your Dentist for the services you receive, but instead processes payments for your Dental Membership Plan on behalf of your Dentist. The Dental Membership Plan is a loyalty program between you and your Dentist. By enrolling in the Dental Membership Plan and making your required payments under the plan, you become eligible to receive Covered Services from a Dentist. These Covered Services are described below. DentalHQ is not an insurance company, it is an intermediary company.</p>
            <p className="term__description"><b>Covered Services</b> include the following: </p>
            <p className="term__description">For Adults: 1 basic cleaning every 6 months (D1110), 1-2 exams (D0120) with cleanings per year, x-rays (D0210, D0274, D0272, D0220, D0330) as determined necessary by your dentist, 1 emergency exam (D0140) per year.</p>
            <p className="term__description">For Minors: 1 basic cleaning every 6 months (D1120), 1-2 exams (D0120) with cleanings per year, x-rays (D0210, D0274, D0272, D0220, D0330) as determined necessary by your dentist, 1 emergency exam (D0140) per year and 1 Fluoride treatment per year (D1208).</p>
            <p className="term__description">In addition, the following terms and conditions apply to the Dental Membership Plan between you and your Dentist:

              <ul>
                <li>You must be current on all payments to maintain your eligibility for services under the Dental Membership Plan;</li>
                <li>You may not combine your Dental Membership Plan with any other discounts, discount plans, dental insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, other forms of government insurance or assistance, and/or any private insurance plan or policy) or office promotions;</li>
                <li>It is possible that, during the course of treatment by your Dentist, he or she may discover a dental or health condition that may require further treatment—the costs associated with any further treatment are your responsibility and are not covered under the Dental Membership Plan;</li>
                <li>Discounts provided under the Dental Membership Plan apply only to services provided by your Dentist, and not products that your Dentist may sell; and</li>
                <li>Any late fees or missed-appointment fees that your Dentist may charge will still apply and will be your responsibility and are not covered under the Dental Membership Plan. You should contact your Dentist regarding any no show penalties before scheduling an appointment.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/oralhealth/Topics/GumDiseases/PeriodontalGumDisease.htm" target="_blank">Periodontal disease</a>, also known as gum disease, can range from relatively-minor gum inflammation to much more serious forms of disease that can damage the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth.  If your Dentist determines that you have periodontal disease, he or she may recommend additional treatment before you are able to have a regular cleaning.  If you do have periodontal disease and require additional treatment, you will be responsible for the costs associated with that treatment.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="term__description">To use the Dental Membership Plan, simply contact the Dentist of your choice, identify yourself as an Enrolled Patient in the Dental Membership Plan, and schedule your appointment. At the time of your appointment you are obligated to pay the Dentist directly for all the non-Covered Services the Dentist provides to you, including any sales or use taxes imposed upon the services; For Covered Services you will not be charged.</p>

              4. LIMITATIONS
            </h4>
            <p className="term__description">Not all dental services are Covered Services under the Dental Membership Plan. Only those specifically listed as Covered Services are provided by Dentists at no additional charge to you.  DentalHQ reserves the right to change, modify or make substitutions in the Dentist List at any time, and from time to time, without notice. Such changes will be reflected on the Site from time to time. If you require any dental services that are not Covered Services, Dentists have agreed to charge you a discount to the current rates that they charge their other patients for providing such non-Covered Services. You must consult with the Dentist for his/her fee schedule for such non-Covered Services. DentalHQ will endeavor to keep the Dentist List up to date such that only participating active Dentists are listed on the Site. DentalHQ strongly recommends that you confirm that a Dentist is currently a Dentist before you receive any services from that Dentist. By enrolling in the Dental Membership Plan, You hereby give permission to DentalHQ and its affiliates to market and offer services to you that are unrelated to the Dental Membership Plan.</p>

              5. CANCELLATION AND RE-ENROLLMENT
            </h4>
            <p className="term__description">You have the right to cancel your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that if your month to month enrollment is cancelled within ninety (90) days after your date of initial enrollment, you will be charged a $20.00 cancellation fee to cover the cost of processing your membership (the “Cancellation Fee”). Note that the Cancellation Fee may not apply in certain situations (See Section 6 REFUND POLICY below). You may cancel your enrollment by email using your personal dashboard or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Cancellations over the telephone cannot be accepted. Refunds will only be provided as set forth in Section 6 REFUND POLICY below.</p>
            <p className="term__description">DentalHQ reserves the right to terminate your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan at any time for any reason, including for the non-payment of your Membership Fee. If DentalHQ terminates your enrollment for any reason, other than the non-payment of your Membership Fee, then DentalHQ will give you a pro-rated refund of your Membership Fee. For example, if DentalHQ terminates an annual enrollment for any reason, other than non-payment of the Membership Fee, at the end of six months during an annual period, the member is entitled to receive a refund of one half of the member’s pre-paid Membership Fee for that one (1)-year period.</p>
            <p className="term__description">If a payment is not received when due, your Account will be placed into “late” status for a period of thirty (30) days. If payment has not been received prior to the end of the thirty (30)-day period, your Account and your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan will become “inactive” and you will no longer be provided with dental services under the Dental Membership Plan. To re-enroll in the Dental Membership Plan, you will be charged a $99 re-enrollment fee in addition to any monthly or annual Membership Fees due.</p>
