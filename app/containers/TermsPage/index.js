            </h4>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              You may enroll on a month to month basis, in which case your monthly Membership Fee will be due monthly in advance or you may enroll for a one (1)-year term in which case the annual Membership Fee will be paid in advance. For both the monthly memberships and the annual membership, we will bill your credit card accordingly.  For monthly memberships, your Dental Membership Plan membership will be automatically renewed at the end of each month, on a month to month basis, and your credit card will be automatically charged the monthly Membership Fee as described above, unless you cancel your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan as provided below.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              For annual memberships, you will receive an email not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current annual period, which will provide instructions for you to renew your membership. Should you elect to renew your membership for the next annual period, your credit card will be charged the then-current annual Membership Fee for the Dental Membership Plan you have selected. We use a third party payment processor to collect and process all payments. In order to make payments you may be required to agree to the third party terms and conditions and/or Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              Your renewal and payment must be received prior to the expiration date of the then current term in order to avoid interruption of your membership in the Dental Membership Plan.

            <p styleName="term__description">
              Your Dentist may increase the monthly and/or annual Membership Fee of the Dental Membership Plan from time to time. You will receive an email notification of any such increase in fees no less than thirty (30) days before the new rate becomes effective. By establishing an Account and enrolling in a Dental Membership Plan through the Site, you hereby authorize DentalHQ to bill for the monthly Membership Fee or annual Membership Fee, as set forth in this agreement. If your credit card or billing information changes, it is your responsibility to provide updated information to us on a timely basis.

You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees pursuant to the fee scheduled you elect at the time of enrollment. It is your responsibility to notify us if your payment method has changed by making the appropriate changes to your account settings.

              3. THE DENTAL MEMBERSHIP PLAN.
            </h4>

            <p styleName="term__description">
              The Dental Membership Plan is a prepaid discount membership program for dental services. It is being offered by the Dentist you have chosen. Certain Dentists have contracted with DentalHQ to offer enrollment in their independent dental membership plans through DentalHQ. These Dental Membership Plans provide a set of specified dental services ("Covered Services") to you for no out-of-pocket fees other than the cost of the Dental Membership Plan. These Covered Services are described below, and are provided in exchange for the cost of the Membership Fee, which reflects a percentage off the Dentistsâ€™ current rates for such dental services. Other services may be provided by your Dentist at discounted rates ("Additional Services") pursuant your Dentistâ€™s fee schedule ("Fee Schedule"). In most cases, the discounted fees are provided at predetermined rates and at a percentage off the Dentistsâ€™ current rates for such designated dental services.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              DentalHQ does not determine the rates for Covered Services, Additional Services, non-covered services, or the Dental Membership Plan offered by your Dentist.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              DentalHQ does not pay your Dentist for the services you receive, but rather processes payments for your Dental Membership Plan on behalf of your Dentist. The Dental Membership Plan is a loyalty program between you and your Dentist. By enrolling in the Dental Membership Plan and making your required payments under the plan, you become eligible to receive the Covered Services from a Dentist of your choosing. These Covered Services are described below.

              <li>
                It is possible that, during the course of treatment by your Dentist, he or she may discover a dental or health condition that may require further treatmentâ€”the costs associated with any further treatment are your responsibility and are not covered under the Dental Membership Plan;

If your Dentist determines that you have periodontal disease, he or she may recommend additional treatment before you are able to have a regular cleaning.  If you do have periodontal disease and require additional treatment, you will be responsible for the costs associated with that treatment.

You will not be charged for the Covered Services other than the payment of your Membership Fee.

            <p styleName="term__description">
              Not all dental services are Covered Services under the Dental Membership Plan. Only those specifically listed as Covered Services are provided by your Dentist at no additional charge to you.  DentalHQ reserves the right to change, modify or make substitutions in the Dentist List at any time, and from time to time, without notice. Such changes will be reflected on the Site from time to time. If you require any dental services that are not Covered Services, Dentists have agreed to charge you a discount to the current rates that they charge their other patients for providing such non-Covered Services. You must consult with the Dentist for his/her fee schedule for such non-Covered Services. DentalHQ will endeavor to keep the Dentist List up to date such that only participating active Dentists are listed on the Site. DentalHQ strongly recommends that you confirm that a Dentist is currently a Dentist before you receive any services from that Dentist. By enrolling in the Dental Membership Plan, You hereby give permission to DentalHQ and its affiliates to market and offer services to you that are unrelated to the Dental Membership Plan.

            <p styleName="term__description">
              You have the right to cancel your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan at any time. Note that, during the first ninety (90) days following your enrollment, you must cancel your enrollment by contacting your Dentist. After you have been enrolled for ninety (90) days, you may cancel your enrollment by email using your personal dashboard on the Site or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address provided in Section 13 below. Cancellations over the telephone cannot be accepted.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              Your Dentist may terminate your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan at any time for any reason, including for the non-payment of your Membership Fee, or for no reason. If your Dentist terminates your enrollment for a reason other than the non-payment of your Membership Fee, then your Dentist will give you a pro-rated refund of your Membership Fee. For example, if your Dentist terminates an annual enrollment at the end of six months during an annual periodâ€”for any reason other than non-payment of the Membership Feeâ€”the member would be entitled to receive a refund of one half of the memberâ€™s pre-paid Membership Fee for that one (1)-year period.
            </p>
            <p styleName="term__description">
              If a payment is not received when due, your Account will be placed into "late" status for a period of thirty (21) days. If payment has not been received prior to the end of the thirty (21)-day period, your Account and your enrollment in the Dental Membership Plan will become "inactive" and you will no longer be provided with dental services under the Dental Membership Plan. Likewise, if you cancel your enrollment after the date ninety (90) days after your date of initial enrollment, your enrollment will become inactive. If your account is inactive, then to re-enroll in the Dental Membership Plan you will be charged a ninety-nine dollar ($99.00) re-enrollment fee in addition to any monthly or annual Membership Fees due.
